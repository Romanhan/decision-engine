Positives: 
Clear Code Structure: The code is well-organized with clear separation of concerns between input validation, credit modifier determination, and loan amount calculation.
Meaningful Method Names: Method names.
Exception Handling: The code utilizes exceptions to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
Adherence to Requirements: The core functionalities seem to align with the provided requirements.

Areas for Improvement:
Primitive Scoring Algorithm: The current credit score calculation is very basic. Consider implementing a more sophisticated scoring model in the future.
SOLID Principles: While the current code demonstrates good organization, there's room for improvement based on SOLID principles.

Most Important Shortcoming (Lack of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)):
I separated calculateCreditScore logic into its own class and getCreditModifier, to simplifies future modifications.
